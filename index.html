        <p>
          I’m a final-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Costa Rica with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and knowledge sharing. My academic and project experience has centered around embedded systems, computer vision, and digital design. I’ve worked with tools and frameworks such as C/C++, Verilog, ROS, OpenCV, and PCL, while developing real-time systems and documenting technical implementations clearly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy collaborating across disciplines, learning new technologies quickly, and contributing to projects that combine engineering and impactful communication. I’m especially excited about opportunities like the Technical Training Development Internship at HPE, where I can apply my technical background, instructional mindset, and attention to detail to develop high-quality training materials and content that help others grow.

      <h3>Research Assistant in Image Processing and Computer Vision Laboratory IPCV-LAB</h3>
      <p><strong>Jan 2024 – Aug 2024 and Mar 2025 – Present | San José, Costa Rica</strong></p>
      <p>
      During this research experience, I contributed to two major projects in the context of autonomous planetary exploration:
      </p>
        <strong>SLAM NIR ToF Monocular:</strong> Assisted in the development of a simultaneous localization and mapping system using Near Infrared and Time-of-Flight video signals for robotic exploration.
        <br>
        <strong>3D Motion Estimation of Fast Robots:</strong> Supported the estimation of fast-moving robots 3D trajectories using multiprocessing of NIR video and ToF depth signals.
      <p>
        Additionally, I led the design, implementation, and testing of a real-time 3D depth visualization system using various sensors (Kinect V2, Stereo Camera, and ToF Camera). This was achieved under Ubuntu using ROS and the PCL library:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Studied ROS Indigo and the Point Cloud Library (PCL).</li>
        <li>Installed and calibrated necessary sensor drivers and packages.</li>

          <p>
            This project involved designing a system to measure the speed and length of aluminum bars in real time using ultrasonic sensors and control logic. Developed in <strong>assembly language for the Dragon12-Plus S12 board</strong>, it includes a full HMI with buttons, LEDs, LCD, and a 7-segment display.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system classifies each bar based on length and activates a spray mechanism when the bar meets a configurable threshold. It operates in multiple modes (STOP, CONFIGURE, SELECT) and uses state machines for control and timing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skills developed:</strong> embedded systems, RTOS, low-level I/O, HMI development.

          <p>
            As part of the final project for the Digital Circuits II course, I designed a Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) block for the 1000BASE-X Ethernet standard, based on IEEE 802.3 clause 36. The main datapath included essential components such as the 8b/10b encoder and decoder, synchronization, and state machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design was implemented in Verilog and validated through a loopback test: data transmitted via <code>TXD</code> was encoded, passed through the PCS, and correctly received through <code>RXD</code> without data corruption. The testbench simulated the transmission of a full Ethernet frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked collaboratively using GitHub and followed a structured methodology, simulation with Icarus Verilog, waveform analysis in GTKwave, and automation with a Makefile.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skills developed:</strong> Verilog HDL, digital design automation, protocol-based hardware design, testbench development, and simulation-based verification.

          <p>
            This project was developed for the <strong>IE-0449 Computer Vision</strong> course at the University of Costa Rica. It focuses on implementing gradient-based edge detection using the Sobel operator, both in offline image processing and real-time video analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project consists of two parts: a C-based desktop application that processes <code>.bmp</code> images and generates grayscale, gradient (X and Y), magnitude, and thresholded edge images; and a <strong>ROS node</strong> that processes live video from a USB camera, displaying all intermediate steps in real time using OpenCV.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this project, I strengthened my skills in <strong>C programming</strong>, <strong>image processing</strong> (Sobel filters, thresholding), <strong>file handling</strong>, and <strong>ROS integration</strong> with <strong>OpenCV</strong> for real-time computer vision applications.

          <p>
            As part of the final project for the Digital Circuits Laboratory course (IE-0424), I designed and implemented a real-time digital audio mixer on the <strong>Nexys A7 FPGA</strong>. The system generates musical notes through a PWM-based audio output, controlled by the onboard switches of the FPGA board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each switch activates a different musical note, synthesized by generating a square wave at a specific frequency. The system was built entirely in <strong>Verilog</strong>, the mixer was connected to the audio output jack of the Nexys A7, allowing for direct speaker playback.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skills developed:</strong> Verilog HDL, PWM signal generation, modular hardware design, clock division, memory-mapped I/O, real-time digital audio synthesis, FPGA prototyping.

          <p>
            This project involved building a meteorological station using humidity, temperature, and luminance sensors (via a photoresistor). The data collected from the sensors was displayed both on additional hardware (LCD screen and LEDs) and through a graphical interface built with <strong>WxPython</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sensor data was sent via the serial port to the computer, where it was shown on the graphical interface, which also generated real-time graphs. The project included designing the necessary circuit to create a fully functional weather station.
          </p>

            <strong>Skills developed:</strong> Arduino, sensor integration, hardware design, C++ programming, WxPython for graphical interfaces.
